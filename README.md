# Hospital-Emergency-Department-Simulator
This was our semester project for the course "Object Oriented Programming"

# Introduction:
This is a piece of software designed to simulate a hospital emergency department simulation environment. An ED is the place where you go when you are potentially seriously ill. Like getting shot.  
The goal of this is to be able to collect important data which will help in designing a more efficient ED management system.

# Implementation:
•	This simulator has been implemented in C++ using the QT Creator IDE for the design and implementation of the GUI.
•	This program uses a single patient class to take care of all things like different types of beds and queues.
•	Weibull and Pearson VI distributions have been used with Rejection Sampling to generate patient details like arrival time, treatment time and post treatment time.
•	Currently it simulates one type of disease only. You may add more if you like but for the sake of our sanity, we have decided to just keep this to one disease for now.
# Key Features:
•	Fully functional
•	Has a GUI
•	Uses OOP principle/s where applicable.
•	Is fully modular.
